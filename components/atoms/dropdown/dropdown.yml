name: dropdown
title: Dropdown
notes: >
  The dropdown component **triggers an action**. Use it when people need to
  perform an action in the page. Do not confuse this component with the [select
  component](#/atoms/select).


  Remember to **keep lists useful**. Clear and short lists are the bests! Long
  lists slow the decision-making process. If you have few items (2 to 3), use
  other components, such as a [link](#/atoms/link) or a
  [button](#/atoms/button).
